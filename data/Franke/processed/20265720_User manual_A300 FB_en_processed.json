This ensures that you retain as much of the flavor as possible. Only pour in as much as you in-\ntend to use in the next few hours on the same day.

Make sure that you reseal open coffee packets properly after\nuse.\nc) Store roasted coffee in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Do not store it in a fridge.\nd) Order only as much roasted coffee as you need – ordering small quantities regularly ensures that you\nalways drink coffee at its freshest.\ne) Order small package sizes, e.g. 250 or 500 g instead of 1 kg. This prevents open packs from being\nstored or too much roasted coffee being poured into the bean hoppers.\nMonitor how much you use over a specific period, e.g. over the course of a week.
