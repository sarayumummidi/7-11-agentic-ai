Limescale deposits may damage the coffee machine. a) Measure the water hardness during commissioning. Then set the water hardness in the Commissioning menu on the basis of the measurement. The hardness level of the water in use determines the capacity of the water filter (only in conjunction with mains water connection) and the amount of water in between descaling cycles. Once the hardness level has been set in the machine program, the coffee machine will automatically prompt you to descale the machine at the correct time. Packaged water hardness measuring strip 1. Remove the measuring strip from the pack- aging. 2. Dip the measuring strip into the water for 1 second. 3. Gently shake off any excess water. ð The color of the measuring strip will change. 4. After one minute, read off the water hard- ness level. The water hardness corresponds to the number of red-colored fields. 5.

Fit the lid. 8.3 Using and storing roasted coffee beans One crucial factor when it comes to optimal in-cup quality is the freshness of the roasted coffee beans used. a) Do not pour roasted coffee beans into the bean hoppers until you are just about to use the coffee ma- chine. This ensures that you retain as much of the flavor as possible. Only pour in as much as you in- tend to use in the next few hours on the same day. Bean hoppers are not storage containers. b) Always close the bean hoppers properly. Make sure that you reseal open coffee packets properly after use. c) Store roasted coffee in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Do not store it in a fridge. d) Order only as much roasted coffee as you need – ordering small quantities regularly ensures that you always drink coffee at its freshest. e) Order small package sizes, e.g. 250 or 500 g instead of 1 kg. This prevents open packs from being stored or too much roasted coffee being poured into the bean hoppers. Monitor how much you use over a specific period, e.g. over the course of a week. Take note of when you need to refill and how much, and use this information to determine how much you will need over the next few hours. Mark the maximum fill level on each bean hopper, e.g. using a sticker. 8.4 Filling powder 1. Lift off the powder hopper lid. 2. Fill with powder suitable for automatic bev- erage dispensers.",

      "text": "Descaling | 11 User manual A300 FB 47 11 DESCALING To maintain consistently high in-cup quality and ensure that the coffee machine runs reliably, the machine must be descaled regularly. For this purpose, the A300 FB has an automatic descaling system. If descaling is necessary, the coffee machine indicates this on the operator panel. Limescale deposits can form in the heating cartridge in particular. To descale the machine, only use the descaler concentrate from Franke (item number 560.0589.837). This guarantees reliable descaling results. a) Make sure that you order descaler concentrate in good time so that you can descale the coffee ma- chine immediately when the prompt appears on the coffee machine operator panel. 11.1 Descaling due date When commissioning the A300 FB, you will be prompted to measure the water hardness and to enter this into the software. Determining the water hardness with a measuring strip [} 26] This value is used to calculate the amount of water until the machine will next need to be descaled. Machines without a water filter A descaling prompt is displayed when the calculated water quantity is reached or, at the latest, after 12 days of operation. The A300 FB can be used for another 2 days after the descaling prompt is first dis- played. After this period, the machine is disabled until descaling is carried out. Machines with a main water connection and water filter A descaling prompt is displayed after 12 days of operation. After the descaling prompt is first displayed, the A300 FB can continue to be used until the remaining water is used up. After this period, the machine is dis- abled until descaling is carried out. 11.2 Descaling If descaling is necessary, a message is displayed on the operator panel. The message can be closed so as not to disrupt operation. The following options are available for starting the descaling process: – Descaling when cleaning is next carried out (default setting) – Descaling independently of cleaning – descaling is started automatically at a specified time – Manually starting descaling NOTICE Discontinuing descaling Applies to machines with a water tank: If the water tank is empty or the drip tray is full, automatic descaling is not carried out. a) Empty the drip tray before cleaning/descaling. b) Fill the water tank before cleaning/descaling. c) Position the cleaning container on the drip grid in accordance with the instructions on the operator panel.",

The aromas of the coffee beans evaporate in the bean hopper as a result of heat and air exchange. The quality will have already deteriorated after 3 hours. a) Coffee beans should not be moist. b) Seal any open coffee bean packs in an airtight manner. c) Do not store coffee beans in a refrigerator or freezer. d) Only fill the coffee beans into the bean hopper that you will need for the next 3 hours.",
