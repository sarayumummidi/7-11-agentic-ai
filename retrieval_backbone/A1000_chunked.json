This de- posited oil ages quickly and impairs the taste of the beverages produced. a) Remove the oil film from the inside of the bean hopper on a daily basis. b) To do this, use a dry cloth or a cloth moistened only with water. c) Do not use any cleaners, as these alter the taste of the coffee. The aromas of the coffee beans evaporate in the bean hopper as a result of heat and air exchange. The quality will have already deteriorated after 3 hours. a) Coffee beans should not be moist. b) Seal any open coffee bean packs in an airtight manner. c) Do not store coffee beans in a refrigerator or freezer. d) Only fill the coffee beans into the bean hopper that you will need for the next 3 hours. 12.4 Help with problems concerning product quality Problem Possible causes Possible remedies Coffee tastes stale Grind too coarse Select a finer grind Setting the grind coarseness [} 38] Too little coffee Increase coffee quantity Menu 2 Cus- tomize beverages [} 64] Temperature too low Increase temperature Menu 2 Custom- ize beverages [} 64] Coffee is stale Use fresh coffee Bean hopper not locked correctly Check the bean hopper latching mecha- nism Coffee tastes strange Poor grind Contact customer service",
